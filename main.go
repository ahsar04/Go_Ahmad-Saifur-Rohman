arr = [21, 34, 5, 7, 9]         To maximize U and minimize the order, arrange the array as [9, 21, 5, 34, 7] so U = 9 × 21 × (1÷5) × 34 × (1÷7) = 183.6. The same U can be achieved using several other orders, e.g. [21, 9, 7, 34, 5] = 21 × 9 × (1÷7) × 34 × (1÷5) = 183.6, but they are not in the minimum order.       Function Description    Complete the function rearrange in the editor.         rearrange has the following parameter(s):        int arr[n]:  an array of integers         Returns        int[n]: the elements of arr rearranged as described         Constraints    1 ≤ n ≤ 105  1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109
